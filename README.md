# Task-Manager-Node.js-MongoDB

This is an API back end for a task manager to learn about MongoDB and Mongoose building a REST API for task manager. It was largely composed of completing challenges while following along with a Udemy tutorial. To extend on and solidify that learning and to more deeply understand how websites would interact with something like this, I created this front end myself for this API with React here: https://github.com/JosephRodolfo/Front-End-For-MongoDB-App-React. 

After finishing the tutorial I continued to make a couple tweaks to make it work better with the front end I created, as well as adjustments to the accepted headers so that it would work in my development environment on my computer.
